# Password-Strength-Analyzer
Python-based Password Strength Analyzer for Cybersecurity
# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

## 📌 Project Description
The Password Strength Analyzer is a Python-based cybersecurity project that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords. It checks passwords using multiple security rules and classifies them as Weak, Medium, or Strong. This project helps users understand secure password creation and basic authentication security.


#Objectives
- Analyze password strength using security rules
- Identify weak and common passwords
- Improve awareness of strong password practices
- Apply cybersecurity concepts using Python


#Features
- Password length validation
- Uppercase letter detection
- Lowercase letter detection
- Number detection
- Special character detection
- Strength scoring system
- Improvement suggestions


#Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Library: re (Regular Expressions)
- Tool: Visual Studio Code


#Working Principle
1. User enters a password in the terminal
2. The program checks password length and character types
3. Each valid rule increases the password score
4. Based on total score, password is classified as:
   - Weak
   - Medium
   - Strong
5. Suggestions are shown for weak passwords


# ▶️ How to Run
1. Install Python 3
2. Open the project folder in VS Code
3. Run the program using:
   python password_checker.py
4. Enter a password when prompted
5. View the result in the terminal

#Sample Output
Enter your password: MyPass123!
Password Strength: Strong
Score: 5 /5

#Applications
- User authentication systems
- Cybersecurity learning projects
- Password policy enforcement

# Future Enhancements
- Add GUI interface
- Password entropy calculation
- Secure hashing implementation
